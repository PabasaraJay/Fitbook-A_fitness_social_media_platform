'Fitbook' is a social media platform designed for fitness enthusiasts. It allows users to share their fitness 
journeys, workouts, healthy meals, and progress through pictures, videos, and status updates. Users can 
create and share workout plans, meal plans, and interact with each other through likes, comments, and 
following profiles. ‘Fitbook’ prioritizes user-friendliness and will be available as a client web application.

The user interface was built with React.js. To connect this interface to the data storage, I used Java
Spring Boot to create a secure REST API. Spring Security and Spring OAuth2 handles user logins and
access permissions within the application.

#### Key Features:</br>
• Easy Media Sharing: Upload pictures and videos (up to 3 photos or 30 seconds) showcasing 
workouts, meals, and progress.</br>
• Real-Time Workout Tracking: Track and share workout metrics (distance, repetitions, weight 
lifted) using templates and providing descriptions.</br>
• Collaborative Workout & Meal Plan Sharing: Design and share customized workout plans and 
meal plans with routines, exercises, sets, recipes, nutritional information, portion sizes and 
repetitions using built-in templates.</br>
• Social Interaction: Enables users to interact with each other by liking and commenting on posts. 
Users can also follow other users' profiles, with all profiles being publicly visible. The platform 
notifies users of likes and comments on their posts, fostering engagement within the community.</br>
• User Authentication: The application allows users to log in using their existing accounts on popular
services such as social media, enhancing convenience and accessibility.</br>
